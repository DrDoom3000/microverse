A 300-particles simulation of the universe. It contains the elements Hydrogen, Helium, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Natrium, Silver, Carbonium, and Iron. Mass, valency, and energy are simulated using a molecular model. Each element has its own color. Try it out, one of the most common molecules is strangely HeSi and HeNa. Si_2 is also common.
